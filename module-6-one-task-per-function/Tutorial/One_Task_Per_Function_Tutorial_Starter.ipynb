    "Design a function that takes a city, a maximum flight duration, and a list of canadian flights and returns **all the flights** in the list that either depart or land in that city and have a flight duration below or equal to the maximum flight duration.\n",

    "In particular, the **function MUST clearly implement these four steps**:\n",
    "1. First, it will find all the flights that depart from the given city,\n",
    "2. Then it will find all the flights that arrive in the given city,\n",
    "3. Then it will add together these two lists to create one list with all flights to or from the required city.\n",
    "4. Then it will find which of these flights has duration less or equal to maximum flight duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints:** \n",
    "- Step 3 should be performed using a simple List concatenation (no function required).\n",
    "- Additional examples of CanadaFlight or Lists may be created to test the functions in this exercise (flight data can be invented and does not need to come from actual flights).\n",
