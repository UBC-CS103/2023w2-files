    "\n",
    "- The deadline of the project milestone has been moved to Monday, March 25 (10PM)\n",
    "- Opportunities to get additional help with the project will be available in class (March 26, April 9 and 11) and during tutorials (last 3 weeks), on top of OH already available and Piazza.\n",
    "- Midterm grades to be released tomorrow - look out for a Piazza announcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important update regarding the last 3 weeks of course\n",
    "- Sadly, I will have to absent myself and will not be able to deliver the last 3 weeks of class in person.\n",
    "- The last lecture on Module 7 (March 28) will be delivered on Zoom and recorded (similarly to what happened during campus closures)\n",
    "- Module 8 (April 2 and 4) will be covered in class by the TAs. I will also post a video to cover the same content, so that you have mutliple sources available.\n",
    "- 2 TAs will be in class during designated in-class OH (March 26, April 9 and 11). I will also be available on Zoom at the same time (be aware of high attendance in both venues). I will also deliver my regular OH (Tu-Th 2-3:15) on Zoom (all links on Canvas).\n",
    "- As I expect more traffic during these OH, I will be using the queue system explained at the top of this [Canvas page](https://canvas.ubc.ca/courses/130118/pages/schedule-tutorials-and-office-hours?module_item_id=6407799). Students not in the queue will not be admitted!"
